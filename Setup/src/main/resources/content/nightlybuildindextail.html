<h4>Build: 2015-03-31</h4>
added: jython script running with sikulixapi.jar::Runner: usage: org.sikuli.script.Runner.run(scriptPath, args), 
sikulixapi.jar and a jython.jar must be on classpath (auto taken from setup downloads if omitted).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-27</h4>
fixed: Mac: a problem that made it to not run any longer with Java 6<br>
revised: MouseMovedCallback feature<br>
added: set callback handler and request visiting the handler before processing a mouse action (on/off)<br>
added: request termination with next mouse action throwing an AssertionError
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
fixed: (I hope ;-) all regression bugs against 1.0.1 in multi monitor environments<br>
revised: ALL in Jython scripts and Screen.all().getRegion() can now be used, to search on all monitors in the same op
(ALL.click(someBotton) will find and click the button, no matter on which monitor it currently is)
<h4>Build: 2015-03-24</h4>
added: multi monitor: a visual can now be found on all screens with one op: Screen.all().getRegion().find(someImage)
will return a match, that knows it's screen, hence match.getScreen() will return the screen it was found on.
Take care: is a lengthy operation and costs some memory, so it should be used with care.
If the match spans screens, the screen with the biggest part is the winner (should be avoided).
<h4>Build: 2015-03-22</h4>
the next days I will somehow reveal more information about the new or revised features<br>
... but many features are already in the docs<br>
<br>
a toy: starting sikulixapi.jar with no parameters reveals a simple edit/save/run dialog for JavaScript trials<br>
added: SikulixAppData/SikulixStore/SikulixDebug.txt if this file is present at startup, then from beginning
we run with debug level 3 and all messages are written to this file (helpful for startup debugging)<br>
added: SikulixAppData/SikulixStore/SikulixOptions.txt is a key/value store according
to the rules of Java property files, that is loaded at startup. The options might overwrite settings
and are available at runtime via getOption... calls (precedence: home folder, work dir, SikulixAppData)<br>
added: SikuliX now has a central repository (SikulixAppData) for all related stuff
in the user's home folder area according according to the standards of the system<br>
added: running scripts can now be paused/continued and aborted by moving the mouse
(detection with next mouse action)<br>
added: one can now run scripts written in JavaScript (edit not yet supported in IDE)<br>
revised: script running in general: -r can have multiple scripts that are run one after the other,<br>

including handling of the bundlePath<br>

can be exported or used from the .exe content (bundled in the original jars)<br>
revised: moved parts of the Sikuli/Jython import handler to the Java level<br>
revised: completely reworked the startup for IDE and API usage, now concentrating all startup requirements in the one
singleton class RunTime<br>
