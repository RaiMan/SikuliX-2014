<br><br>
The following jars would be downloaded automatically when running setup.
<br><br>
So you only would need to manually download, if you are having problems with setup's inline download.
<br>
If you download manually, the jars have to be in a folder Downloads in the folder containing sikulixsetup-X.Y.jar.
<br>
Setup will find the local files and ask you to use them instead of downloading fresh versions.<br><br>
BE AWARE: These files are not useable for any other purpose than being processed by sikulixsetup.
