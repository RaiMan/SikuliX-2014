Sikuli Basics 2014 (version 1.1.x)
===

Implements basic ustility and helper features used in the top level packages (basic file and folder handling, download features, jar access and handling, export of native libraries, parameter and preferences handling, update and extension handling, ...) and hence it is contained in all packages.

As a special feature it comprises the `sikuli-setup.jar`, which is run after download to build the wanted Sikuli packages and make them ready-to-use on the specific system (Windows, Mac or Linux).
